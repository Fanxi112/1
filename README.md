# Introduction in INFO574
Hi guys! My name is Fanxi Chen. I am a beginner in code, and I'll try my best in studying this course. 
About me, I love pets, and I have three cats that I adopted from shelters. Their names are Porter, Honey, and Yuanbao. We had a lot of cozy time, and I love them sooooo much!
